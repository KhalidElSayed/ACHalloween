### Bloodtrail

ACBloodtrailView: a UIView showing blood trails falling from the top (gore!). When they reach the bottom of the view, the bloodtrail disappear. Also, blood disappears if you tap with your finger on the trail.

## Note

This is old code from a zombie app I worked on years ago (when I was young, foolish and unexperienced) and I found it back recently. It was never released and I tought now might be the good time (Halloween) to do so. That being said, I adapted it to make it work again but be warned it's probably not the best code ever.
